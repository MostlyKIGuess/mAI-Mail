Do the names of our elements of the data-structures be exactly the same as the ones given in the assignment sheet? For example, if the elements of the post ADT are named &quot;username&quot;, &quot;caption&quot; and
&quot;comments&quot; instead of &quot;Username&quot;, &quot;Caption&quot; and &quot;Comments&quot; is it fine?
