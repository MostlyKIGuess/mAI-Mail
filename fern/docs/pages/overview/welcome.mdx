## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

PrivateGPT provides an **API** containing all the building blocks required to
build **private, context-aware AI applications**.
The API follows and extends OpenAI API standard, and supports both normal and streaming responses.
That means that, if you can use OpenAI API in one of your tools, you can use your own PrivateGPT API instead,
with no code changes, **and for free** if you are running privateGPT in `local` mode.

Do you want to install it on Windows? Or do you want to take full advantage of your hardware for better performances?
