# Reset Local documents database

When running in a local setup, you can remove all ingested documents by simply
deleting all contents of `local_data` folder (except .gitignore).

To simplify this process, you can use the command:
```bash
make wipe
```

# Advanced usage

You can actually delete your documents from your storage by using the
API endpoint `DELETE` in the Ingestion API.
