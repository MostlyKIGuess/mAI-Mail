# Settings and profiles for your private GPT

The configuration of your private GPT server is done thanks to `settings` files (more precisely `settings.yaml`).
These text files are written using the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) syntax.

While privateGPT is distributing safe and universal configuration files, you might want to quickly customize your
privateGPT, and this can be done using the `settings` files.

This project is defining the concept of **profiles** (or configuration profiles).
This mechanism, using your environment variables, is giving you the ability to easily switch between
configuration you've made.

A typical use case of profile is to easily switch between LLM and embeddings.
To be a bit more precise, you can change the language (to French, Spanish, Italian, English, etc) by simply changing
the profile you've selected; no code changes required!

PrivateGPT is configured through *profiles* that are defined using yaml files, and selected through env variables.
The full list of properties configurable can be found in `settings.yaml`.

## How to know which profiles exist
Given that a profile `foo_bar` points to the file `settings-foo_bar.yaml` and vice-versa, you simply have to look
at the files starting with `settings` and ending in `.yaml`.

## How to use an existing profiles
**Please note that the syntax to set the value of an environment variables depends on your OS**.
You have to set environment variable `PGPT_PROFILES` to the name of the profile you want to use.

For example, on **linux and macOS**, this gives:
```bash
export PGPT_PROFILES=my_profile_name_here
```

Windows Powershell(s) have a different syntax, one of them being:
```shell
set PGPT_PROFILES=my_profile_name_here
```
If the above is not working, you might want to try other ways to set an env variable in your window's terminal.

Once you've set this environment variable to the desired profile, you can simply launch your privateGPT,
and it will run using your profile on top of the default configuration.

## Reference
Additional details on the profiles are described in this section

### Environment variable `PGPT_SETTINGS_FOLDER`

The location of the settings folder. Defaults to the root of the project.
Should contain the default `settings.yaml` and any other `settings-{profile}.yaml`.

### Environment variable `PGPT_PROFILES`

By default, the profile definition in `settings.yaml` is loaded.
Using this env var you can load additional profiles; format is a comma separated list of profile names.
This will merge `settings-{profile}.yaml` on top of the base settings file.

For example:
`PGPT_PROFILES=local,cuda` will load `settings-local.yaml`
and `settings-cuda.yaml`, their contents will be merged with
later profiles properties overriding values of earlier ones like `settings.yaml`.

During testing, the `test` profile will be active along with the default, therefore `settings-test.yaml`
file is required.

### Environment variables expansion

Configuration files can contain environment variables,
they will be expanded at runtime.

Expansion must follow the pattern `${VARIABLE_NAME:default_value}`.

For example, the following configuration will use the value of the `PORT`
environment variable or `8001` if it's not set.
Missing variables with no default will produce an error.

```yaml
server:
  port: ${PORT:8001}
```
